# chatGPT-stream

This repository provides a simple implementation of streaming OpenAI API completions using JavaScript. It enables interactive generative responses from the GPT-3.5-turbo model.

The implementation utilizes HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and pure JavaScript. It leverages the OpenAI API to send requests for generating responses and incorporates the streaming feature to receive and display responses in real-time as they become available.
